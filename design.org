** Referential Transparency

** Referential Opacity

** Command Query Separation
- Seperate an object's methods into:
  - *Queries*: that query data without changing the state of the object (no side effect)
  - *Commands*: that change the state of the object without returning anything

* Principles
** Law of Demeter
- /Only talk to your friends/
- *Very useful for Refactoring*
- Basic Rules:
  - Your method can call other methods on Its class directly
  - You method can call methods on objects It references in Its fields (but not the fields' fields)
  - Your method can call methods on objects It created
  - Your method can call methods on objects passed as parameters
  - Your should not have call trains get().get()...

** Item 16: Favor composition over inheritence
- /Is A/ *vs* /Has A/
