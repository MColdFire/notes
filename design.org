** Fluent Interface
- Method of designing a readable/fluent interface, based on method chaining
** Failover
- Capacity to transfer control from a primary system which suffers an issue to a backup system
- Ref: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1202/failover
** Serverless compution
- Ref: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32477/serverless-computing

** Referential Transparency
- A property of programming constructs.
- A function or method that can be replaced by Its returned value, *without changing the behavior
  of the program* is referentially transparent
- Ref: http://wiki.c2.com/?ReferentialTransparency
** Referential Opacity
** Reification
** Coroutine

** Beck Design Rules

** Workflows of Refactoring
- Ref: https://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/
** Branch by Abstraction 
- Ref: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html
** Rules
- *switch* -> think polymorphism

* Patterns
** Command Query Separation
- Seperate an object's methods into:
  - *Queries*: that query data without changing the state of the object (no side effect)
  - *Commands*: that change the state of the object without returning anything
- Ref: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html
** Fire And Forget
- Ref: http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/conversation/FireAndForget.html
** Active Object
- Implementation of the Active Object Pattern is Typed Actors from Akka
  http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/java/typed-actors.html
- Ref: http://wiki.c2.com/?ActiveObject
** Specification
- Pattern described by Eric Evans (in DDD book) and Martin Fowler
- Ref: https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf
- Ref: http://blog.xebia.fr/2009/12/29/le-pattern-specification-pour-la-gestion-de-vos-regles-metier/
** Flyweight
- Use sharing to support large number of objects (characters in a text file)

* Principles
** SOLID
*** SRP: Single Responsability Principle
*** OCP: Open Closed Principle
*** LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle
- Derived class objects must be substitutable for the base class objects
- Objects of the derived class must behave in a manner *consistent with the promises made in the base 
  class' contract*
- Ref: http://wiki.c2.com/?LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple
*** ISP: Interface Segregation Principle
*** DIP: Dependency *Inversion* Principle
** Law of Demeter
- /Only talk to your friends/
- *Very useful for Refactoring*
- Basic Rules:
  - Your method can call other methods on Its class directly
  - You method can call methods on objects It references in Its fields (but not the fields' fields)
  - Your method can call methods on objects It created
  - Your method can call methods on objects passed as parameters
  - Your should not have call trains get().get()...
*** DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
*** SPOT: Single Point Of Truth

* Effective Java
** Item 16: Favor composition over inheritence
- /Is A/ *vs* /Has A/
