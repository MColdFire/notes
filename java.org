# JAVA

* TK
- Heap Pollution
  - Situation that occurs if a parametrized type refers to an object that is not of that parametrized type
  - Causes *unchecked warning* at compile tim
  - Can cause ClassCastException at runtime.
- SAM Interfaces
  - Single Abstract Method Interfaces: Interface with a single abstract method
  - Examples: Runnable, Callable, ActionListener...
- Functional Interface
  - Interface with exactly one abstract mehod
  
* Concurrency
- JAVA-RS: Jsr 311, The JavaTM API for RESTful Web Services
  - *Jersey*: Reference implementation of JAX-RS
- CompletableFuture
- CompletionStage
- ThreadLocal:

* Useful Commands
- jps: ps for java processes
  - -l long listing
  - -v jvm parameter
  - -m parameters
- jmap: can print heap dump of a jvm
  - jmap -dump:format=b,file=snapshot.jmap pid
- jmap: can print heap histogram
  - jmap -histo pid
  
* HASHMAP
- Load factor: When the size of the hashmap reaches 75% of current (internal array) size, 
  It doubles the size by recomputing hashcodes of existing data strucutre elements.
  => *Best practice to give the size of the hashmap during creation*
- Return of 'V put(K, V)': Previous V associated with K, or null if K not existing before,
  or null if K was mapped to null.

* Java Keywords
- transient field: not to be serialized during serialization
  Ex: HashMap has its internal array as transient. HashMap implements the writeObject and
  readObject methods, which allows it to reconstruct the array.
  
* Maven
- Run a specific test class:
  - mvn test -Dtest=MyTestClassName
